# Project 3: Problems vs Algorithms

## Problem 7 explanation

We solve this problem by implementing 3 classes: RouteTrie, RouteTrieNode, and Router

The algorithm handles n number of pages, which is kept in memory making the space complexity O(n).

To implement the search functionality the algorithm verifies n number of pages making the time complexity O(n) for this algorithm.
