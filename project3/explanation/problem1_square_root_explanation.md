# Project 3: Problems vs Algorithms

## Problem 1 explanation

In this problem, the approach is to use binary search to find the square root of the provided integer.
We return middle number as the square root if it is in the range of middle number and the middle number plus 1.
The time complexity is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(1)
