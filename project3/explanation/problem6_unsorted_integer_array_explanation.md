# Project 3: Problems vs Algorithms

# Problem 6 explanation

Both the time and space complexities are O(n) since the algorithm handles n elements while running.
The approach taken here is to find the minimum and maximum, which are set initially using 2 variables that get updated while iteration over the provided list. We only iterate one time and update the values of the minimum and maximum variables.

The time complexity is O(n).

The algorithm takes n number of items in memory making the space complexity O(n).
