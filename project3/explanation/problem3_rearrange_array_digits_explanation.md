# Project 3: Problems vs Algorithms

## Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits explanation 

To solve this problem, we use merge sort utility function with a time complexity of O(nlog(n)).

- The merge sort algorithm has a space complexity of O(n) and the rearrangement method also has a space complexity of O(n), hence the overall space complexity of the solution is O(n).
