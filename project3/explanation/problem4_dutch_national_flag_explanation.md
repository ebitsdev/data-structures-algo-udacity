# Project 3: Problems vs Algorithms
# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

To solve this problem, we need split the provided list in 3 separate sub-lists consisting of ones, twos, and trees in one iteration.
Once that is done, we merge the tree lists into a single list.

The time and space complexity is O(n).
