# Project 3 - Problems vs Algorithms

## Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries Explanation

To solve this problem, we create two classes TrieNode and Trie with search and insertion methods.

To solve this problem, we create two classes TrieNode and Trie.

* Using the find method, the algorithm searches for n number of characters. The time complexity is O(n).
* In this solution the space complexity is O(n), the algorithm only keeps n number of words without taking up extra space for identical words or part of words.
