# File recursion

To solve this problem of file recursion, I am using recursion to search for files in the main directory and subdirectories. There are two for loops, the first loop is to search for files in the main directory. The second loop is to look helps to find files in the nested directories after checking if the item is a directory.

The time complexity for this problem is O(n), n being the number files and subdirectories respectively.
The space complexity is O(n) for this solution.
