# Blockchain solution solution explanation

For the blockchain solution, I am using linked list data structure to solve the problem.
I created one object called MyBlockchain with 2 methods: the chain_block and show_block_details.
The first method sets the linked list head, timestamp, data and chains the blocks together.
The second method prints the details of the blockchain outputting data, timestamp, hash, and previous hash.

The space complexity for this problem is O(n).
The time complexity is O(n) with the show_block_details method.
